## Project title

Linguistic Appropriation of African American Vernacular

### Research area and problem

Cultural appropriation has been a hot topic in recent years. One aspect of this is linguistic appropriation where white communities adopt vernacular that is popular in black communities and use it as their own.

### Research aim and question
How does pop culture display this linguistic appropriation? How relevant is this appropriation in the top Billboard songs of the last decade?
